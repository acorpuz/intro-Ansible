# Ansible template repository #
A generic template repository from which you can create other Ansible repositories with playbooks.  
Note that if you are creating a repository for an Ansible role there is a specific template you can use (template\_repo-ansible\_role).

The files included are this README\_FIRST.md, a generic README.md and a standard .gitignore; README.txt placeholders are there to allow adding directories to the repo.

Fill in the README.md with specific details as needed.
